Self-hosted Daily Routine Checklist

Note:

Paused working on this after 4+ hours of Github Copilot issues:

<https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues/4644>

This intermittent outage is a recurring issue and some days it starts working in an hour or two, some days like today, it continues well past my patience threshold.

Copilot can be quite a useful tool - if/when it works. Today is not the day it does though.
