Self-hosted Daily Routine Checklist

## 21 Prompts?

Act was created in a matter of hours during a handful sessions of using Github Copilot with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. You'll find every prompt used to get to this point in PROMPTS.md.

## Status

Kinda-sorta works, if you squint a little. Has major usability issues that I was unable to resolve via prompts. I might give this another try with a different prompting strategy later.
